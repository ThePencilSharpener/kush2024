    "I talked with Gyutae Kim about how to get my Final Exam materials organized. Since both of our roles were Backend Engineer, we discussed what 5 things we could say as well as helping each other do the MCQ. We checked each other's blog for mistakes, poor explanations, and whether we satisfied all the requirements. We also practiced explaining our project, feature, MCQ, FRQ's, 5 things we did, and everything else to each other in preparation for the check."

    "* **Grade: 4.7/5**\n",
    "* **Reasoning:** I successfully contributed to 5 major things across the project. The Kanban board, team collaboration, and stand-up meetings on the regular kept me on track and kept the vision for the project clear. However there have been a few instances over the past 12 weeks were my issues were not organized very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Full Stack Project Demo**\n",
    "* **Grade: 1.8/2**\n",
    "* **Reasoning**: We demonstrated our features effectively and showed how they tied together to meet the project's purpose. I actively participated in both presenting and troubleshooting. However our features could also literally take data from other features within the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Project Feature Blog Write-up**\n",
    "* **Grade: 0.975/1**\n",
    "* **Reasoning**: The write-up was done with the use of CPT/FRQ language. I used cause, reasoning, and fix-reflections to write it. I believe I lacked a little bit in technical detail in my write-up, but I think I can learn through the college board videos and reading the materials Mr. Mort provided us.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **MCQ**\n",
    "* **Grade: 0.975/1**\n",
    "* **Reasoning**: The MCQ was a straightforward assignment, with lot's of questions about psuedocode and what a speific function will return. However I did not get all the questions correct; I got a 56/67 on the MCQ. I wrote a reflection and analyzed the top 5 topics I felt I did not understand and needed to prepare for before the actual AP exam.\n",

    "5. **10th point**\n",

    "* **Reasoning:** I do not think that I impressed Mr. Mort too much with my feature and my blog write-ups. However I hope he recognizes the work me and my group put in to complete all the requirements and recommendations Mr. Mort gave us. I went to N@TM to present our project as well as show off my feature to other students of the class and their parents. I left many google reviews on different groups about the things I liked as well as things I feel like they can improve on, showing my interest in other projects. In addition I gave advice to Rutvik(table 1 CSP P5) on the game he made. I also worked closely with Gyutae Kim on preparing the materials for the Final Exam. We called together multiple times to discuss what we should put in our blogs, what the 5 things could be, what CPT/FRQ language is, and just helping each other in general.\n",

There is still room for improvement in terms of literally connecting my groupmates features. My and my team mates worked together hard to meet the requirements and recommendations and I feel like that can be somewhat seen through our project. I have asked my mother, who is a software engineer, for help multiple times throughout this trimester and she has always been very impressed with what we are doing in this class, from doing things such as a retrospective, or working in agile teams, or doing sprints. She tells me that this is what she does all the time in her job. I have found out the skills I am strong in and skills I am weak in. I will use these skills all throughout life and not just in trimester 3.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**\n",
    "1. I would like for users to be able to look at the previous ages that they had inputted and be able to compare their efficiency in achieving their goal. A visual representation of this would be most effective such as a bar graph or a line graph to show the rate at which they are achieving their goal. To achieve the chart, a function would have to be created so that only integers could be inputted for their age and a function to create and display a graph would have to be created. A spellchecker is something that I believe could enhance the UI of my feature, making the UI more appealing to users and just overall providing a better experience."

I also struggled a lot to fix the restore function. Every time I would run the restore function, lots of errors would show up. To fix this I did a deep dive into the scripts restore file where I learned that one of the models in the database had a few errors causing the error in restore. I was then able to fix those errors and resolve the issue.\n",
