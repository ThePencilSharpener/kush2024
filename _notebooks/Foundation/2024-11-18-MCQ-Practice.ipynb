    "<p>A: What I learned from this quiz is how to read psuedocode properly and understand the different symbols within it. I also learned a lot about logic gates and how they can be used to simply represent an idea or code.</p>\n",
    "<p>B: I am weak in understanding and remembering the vocab terms presented to us.</p>\n",
    "<p> Q65: Answer is B and D</p>\n",
    "<p>Explanation: Answer is B and D because Y is negative in those options so count will never be able to reach a negative number if we are adding 1 each time to count. So these options are the ony conditions where the procedure will not return the correct product.</p>\n",
    "<p> Q64: Answer is B and C</p>\n",
    "<p>Explanation: Cloud Computing is where information can be delivered over the internet and some features is that it has help to enhance collaboration but it also has data-security concenrns.</p>\n",
    "<p> Q63: Answer is Line 4 and Line 9</p>\n",
    "<p>Expalnation: The psuedocode is setting count=0 each time it runs a loop and that is resetting the count. This is why line 4 is to be removed. Line 9 is removed because it makes it so count is increased for all entires not just prime entries.</p>\n",
    "<p> Q58: Answer is A</p>\n",
    "<p>Explanation: Option A is correct because crowdsourcing does not allow for all computational problems to be solved in reasonable time, it allows for participants to access useful tools, and it can lower geographic barriers.</p>\n",
    "<p> Q48: Answer is D</p>\n",
    "<p>Explanation: The answer is D because it is the only one saying for any value under 75 making sure it is 75% unlike everyone else.</p>\n",
    "<p> Q43: Answer is A</p>\n",
    "<p>Explanation: The algoritihm runs in reasonable time because the number of steps is a polynomial.</p>\n",
    "<p> Q42: Answer is D</p>\n",
    "<p>Explanation: With 32-bit addressing there are 2^32 possible addresses. So with 128-bit addressing there has to be 2^96 times as many possible addresses.</p>\n",
    "<p> Q37: Answer is C</p>\n",
    "<p>Explanation: Both code segments display the correct average but code segment 1 has more arithmetic operations within the loop instead of collecting the data and doing it outside the loop.</p>\n",
    "<p> Q17: Answer is D</p>\n",
    "<p>Explanation: Giving free education on how to use new technology, providing free or low-cost tech, and providing networks and infrastructure would all help to reduce the digital divid eof the world.</p>\n",
    "<p> Q14: Answer is D</p>\n",
    "<p>Program A and B both display the same number of values but have different values because the second program starts at 2 instead of 1.</p>"
