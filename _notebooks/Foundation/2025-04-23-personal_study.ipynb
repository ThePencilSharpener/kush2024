    "- **Know Binary**: There were lots of questions relating to binary and specific values are sometimes assigned binary. Practice binary online through KhanAcademy()\n",
    "## THERE WERE LOTS AND LOTS OF PSUEDOCODE, MAKE SURE TO UNDERSTAND IT\n",
    "- **Properly understand psuedocode**: There were numeruous questions about what a specific function does; and that function would be in Psuedocode. Know all the operators(ie. NOT, AND, OR, etc.) and conditional statements(IF, ELSE, ELIF, etc.) \n",
    "- **Vocab**: Questions with key vocabulary(phishing, keylogging, public key encryption, etc.). Lots of qestions about vocabulary; if you don't know what important words mean you can't answer the problem thats why I should review each lesson and make a list of common or/and important vocab words to practice(flash cards)\n",

    "- **Educational Guess**: If I don't know an answer, choose the one that makes the most sense\n",
    "- **Be aware of time**: 1 reason I felt I did not do well on this MC is because I did properly manage my time. I spent too long on some problems and I got tired easily. Practice test stamina\n",

    "# Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing Innovations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Positive and Negative Effects\n",
    "In our studies, we saw how computing technologies can have both helpful and harmful consequences. For example, social media makes it easier to stay in touch with others, but it can also lead to mental health concerns and spread false information. These examples reminded us that tech must be thoughtfully created and used, keeping its broader effects on people and communities in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Digital Divide\n",
    "We explored how unequal access to technology affects different populations. Many people in rural or low-income areas face challenges in education and employment due to limited internet or digital resources. This topic highlighted why closing the digital divide is a crucial part of improving access and equity in computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bias in Algorithms\n",
    "We looked into how bias can show up in algorithms if they're trained with skewed or incomplete data. Examples like facial recognition errors and unfair hiring tools helped us see the real-world impact. We discussed ways to address bias, such as using more representative datasets and carefully reviewing algorithm behavior during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Crowdsourcing\n",
    "We talked about how large groups collaborate online on things like Wikipedia or open-source software. Crowdsourcing invites many contributors, but also makes it harder to ensure accuracy and maintain quality. This gave us insight into both the power and complexity of collaborative computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Legal and Ethical Concerns\n",
    "Our lessons also covered data privacy, copyright laws, and how tech companies handle user data. We debated whether users are properly informed when their information is collected. These discussions helped us think more deeply about the ethical responsibilities developers and organizations have.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Safe Online Habits\n",
    "We went over important cybersecurity practices like using strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication. We also learned how to avoid common online threats like phishing scams and malware. These lessons were a great reminder of how we can protect ourselves and act wisely in digital spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Search\n",
    "We studied binary search, a method that quickly finds values in a sorted list by repeatedly narrowing down the search space. Comparing it with linear search showed us how much more efficient it is for larger datasets. Writing our own versions gave us hands-on experience with conditions and loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with Lists and Filters\n",
    "We created programs that use lists and filters to organize or search through data. This taught us how iteration and selection help solve everyday problems, like sorting information or finding specific matches in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Big-O Notation\n",
    "We learned to use Big-O notation to describe how an algorithm's performance changes with larger inputs. We compared examples like constant-time, linear-time, and quadratic-time algorithms to see which ones are most efficient for different types of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Randomness in Coding\n",
    "We explored how randomness is used in things like games and simulations. Using random values can add variety and help simulate unpredictable events, showing us another tool programmers use to create dynamic systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Simulations\n",
    "Simulations let us explore how systems work without affecting the real worldâ€”like predicting traffic or modeling the climate. We also learned that simulations have limits and depend on the assumptions we build them with.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Undecidable Problems\n",
    "We explored certain problems that computers simply canâ€™t solve completely, such as the Halting Problem. These concepts showed us that computing has its boundaries and that some challenges are beyond algorithmic solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graphs and Heuristics\n",
    "We also studied how graphs represent relationshipsâ€”like routes in a GPS appâ€”and how heuristics help find good-enough answers when exact solutions are too difficult. These tools are powerful in solving complex real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Study Plan for the Future\n",
    "To keep improving, Iâ€™ll use flashcards and targeted practice to stay sharp on each Big Idea. Iâ€™ll regularly revisit CollegeBoard multiple-choice questions and reinforce my learning by explaining concepts to classmates. Rotating topics weekly and tracking my progress will help me stay consistent. Iâ€™ll also keep working on algorithms and simulations to strengthen my problem-solving and computational thinking for the exam.\n",
