My journey to getting this website and downloading all of the necessary tools has been fraught with peril. I cry myself to sleep over the error codes I see in my dreams. I wish not to sleep for fear of the red text that looms in my head slowly driving me to the edge to insanity. I drive my nails into my skin with anger and hatred of the cursed red text.


I will never stop cursing this setup and so generations and generations of my offspring will inherit my anger for this red text.
