    "## Things I noticed in all the MC's + What to practice mainly on the test\n",
    "- **Know Binary**: There were lots of questions relating to binary and specific values are sometimes assigned binary. Practice binary online through KhanAcademy()\n",
    "## THERE WERE LOTS AND LOTS OF PSUEDOCODE, MAKE SURE TO UNDERSTAND IT\n",
    "- **Properly understand psuedocode**: There were numeruous questions about what a specific function does; and that function would be in Psuedocode. Know all the operators(ie. NOT, AND, OR, etc.) and conditional statements(IF, ELSE, ELIF, etc.) \n",
    "- **Vocab**: Questions with key vocabulary(phishing, keylogging, public key encryption, etc.). Lots of qestions about vocabulary; if you don't know what important words mean you can't answer the problem thats why I should review each lesson and make a list of common or/and important vocab words to practice(flash cards)\n",

    "## Some test taking strategies:\n",
    "- **Educational Guess**: If I don't know an answer, choose the one that makes the most sense\n",
    "- **Be aware of time**: 1 reason I felt I did not do well on this MC is because I did properly manage my time. I spent too long on some problems and I got tired easily. Practice test stamina\n",
    "- **Rule out obvious**: If an answer is very obviously wrong take it out of consideration and take a chance with the other ones(If I do this once or twice, the odds of me getting the answer right is 50/50)\n",
