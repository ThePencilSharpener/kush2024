    "##  Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This trimester was fun and I learned a lot of exciting things, such as how machine learning works. My goal for this trimester was to get a 5 on the AP CSP exam. One thing I really improved on was how to debug more effectively using `console.log()` statements and `print()` to understand how my code flows. A major milestone for me was integrating machine learning into one of my final projects, which made me feel like I was working on something that had real-world impact. Overall, I genuinely enjoyed computer science this trimester and feel more confident as a developer.\n",

    "###  Problems and How I Fixed Them\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CORS Error when submitting scores**: Resolved by properly configuring Flask-CORS and testing endpoints using Postman.\n",
    "- **Merge Conflicts in Git**: Used `git rebase`, `merge`, and VSCode source control tools to fix branches cleanly.\n",
    "- **Debugging Frontend Logic**: Used `console.log()` and `print()` to trace logic and catch edge-case bugs.\n",
    "- **Quiz Game not saving points**: Traced through database relationship issues and fixed ORM mapping.\n",

    "### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "This reflection is based on my performance across three years of AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) multiple-choice question sets: 2018, 2020, and 2021. Each year provided insight into my understanding of the curriculum, which covers topics from data and programming to the internet and global impact. I showed significant growth in the Algorithms and Programming section, especially in areas like conditionals, iteration, and algorithm development. For example, my iteration scores improved from 91% in 2018 to 100% in both 2020 and 2021. Topics like calling procedures and binary search, which were initially low or incomplete, saw gradual increases. In the Data section, I consistently scored 100% in areas such as binary numbers, data compression, and data extraction, indicating a strong grasp of data-related concepts. I also performed well in the Global Impact and Internet sections, maintaining high scores across topics like the digital divide, computing bias, and safe computing. However, some areas still need improvement. Boolean expressions were challenging at first, scoring 0% in 2018, although I improved by 2020. Binary search remained a weak spot, with 0% in both 2018 and 2021. Additionally, my understanding of mathematical expressions was inconsistent, scoring 67% in 2018 and 100% in 2020 but lacking data for 2021. Overall, Iâ€™ve made strong progress across most units, especially in data and societal impact, and with more focused practice on certain algorithm topics, I can continue to improve my performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "My favorite project was the **Machine Learning Topic Predictor**. I really enjoyed learning about how machine learning models work and training one on data I collected and cleaned. It gave me a look into how these tools are used in the real world, especially in education, science, and automation. This was a turning point where I felt like a real developer solving real-world problems.\n",
