More feedback such as literally connecting my feature to my group-mates features and getting rid of alert's as the method for informing the user of their actions, could have been implemented into my code. I tested my CRUD operations using Postman to isolate the problem to either the fronted or backend code. I also used Postman to see what error message my code gives and what the problem is. I tested my feature locally first before deploying so if any errors occurred I could isolate the problem to a select few files or lines of code. I asked other group-mates what they thought of my feature and how to make it better and incorporated the input age based on their feedback. "
