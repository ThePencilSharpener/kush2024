    "<p>Purpose: The purpose of my individual feature was to create a page where people can post facts about those they look up to, and after how long that fact will become a reality about them. This is so that people can set expectations on themselves similar to how the people they look up too once did. With these expectations now written out and saved online, they can now achieve this, all while continuously updating the amount of time it would take for them to achieve that goal. An example of this would be: Lionel Messi's first club was FC Barcelona located in Barcelona, Spain. Time it will take for me to play for FC Barcelona: 5 years. I will continuously update the time it will take for me to get there as certain events happen. An example of these certain events would be, a scout has taken interest in me: 2 years till I play at Barcelona. I am playing for team USA U19: 6 months till I play at Barcelona.</p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<p>The CoolFact feature was designed to help people lacking in motivation to set expectations upon themselves. As they do the research about the fact of the person they look up too, they will start to understand that the road to success is not easy and that they will struggle for many years before they achieve their goal. This will show them that they are not alone and can achieve their goals.</p>"

    "## **Class: `CoolFactsAPI`**\n",
    "- Contains the `_CRUD` inner class, which defines API endpoints for **creating, reading, updating, and deleting** \"CoolFacts\" entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **CRUD Operations (`_CRUD` class)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. `post()` (Create)**\n",
    "- Receives JSON data from a client request.  \n",
    "- Creates a new `CoolFacts` entry with `age` and `coolfacts`.  \n",
    "- Saves it in the database and returns the created entry as JSON.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. `put()` (Update)**\n",
    "- Receives JSON data with `age` and `coolfacts`.  \n",
    "- Finds the matching entry in the database.  \n",
    "- Updates the `coolfacts` and `age` fields if the entry exists.  \n",

    "- **Error Handling:** Includes error messages for missing data, entry not found, and server errors.  \n",

    "  - `id` (Primary Key, Integer)\n",

    "## 2. CRUD Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`create()`**: Adds and commits a new record to the database.\n",
    "- **`read()`**: Returns the fact's details as a dictionary.\n",
    "- **`update()`**: Updates an existing record and commits the changes.\n",
    "- **`delete()`**: Deletes the record from the database.\n",

    "* Delete(DELETE): Allows a user to delete a coolfact and age based on it's id. Both the coolfact and age is deleted from the database.\n",

    "* Check SQLite data tables whether data is being added, updated, and removed correctly using correct sqlite commands\n",
    "* Learn how to rebuild properly using the proper docker-compose command\n",
    "* Changing port numbers and files to work on deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Init, Backup, Restore**\n",
    "* Restore, Backup, and Init: Add init, backup, and restore functions to each feature(done by adding each feature to each function in main so all of them get run at once instead of one at a time)\n",
    "* Add each API to main.py and functions within it\n",
